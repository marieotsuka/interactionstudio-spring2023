This is the class website for Core 2 Interaction Studio at Parsons The New School, Spring 2023, Section F with Marie Otsuka. Mike Bowser is teaching the Lab counterpart for this class. The class content is founded on the Core Interaction Curriculum of Communications Design department at The New School, coordinated by [Nika Simovich Fisher](https://www.nikafisher.com/teaching.html).

The website structure and materials are based on previous classes I have taught at RISD and CCA, and influenced by the work of [Chris Hamamoto](http://chrishamamoto.com/), [Minkyoung Kim](http://minkyoungkim.com/home/), and [Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com/). The website is a static site generated by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and the full code for this site is available on [Github](https://github.com/marieotsuka/interactionstudio-spring2023). Typefaces used are Caper, an in-progress variable font designed by Marie Otsuka, and `IBM Plex Mono` for typesetting code.

The website will evolve as we progress through our class â€” please check back often for up to date resources.
