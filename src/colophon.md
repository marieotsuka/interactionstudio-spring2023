This is the class website for Core 2 Iteraction Studio at Parsons The New School, Spring 2023 with Marie Otsuka. 

The site structure and materials are influenced by the work of [Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com/), [Minkyoung Kim](http://minkyoungkim.com/home/), [Chris Hamamoto](http://chrishamamoto.com/), and previous classes I have taught. 

The site is a static site generated by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and the full code for this site is available on [Github](hhttps://github.com/marieotsuka/interactionstudio-spring2023).

Typefaces used are **Caper**, an in-progress variable font designed by Marie Otsuka, and **IBM Plex Mono** for typesetting code.

The website will evolve as we progress through our class â€” please check back often for up to date resources.
