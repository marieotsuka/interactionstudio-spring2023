When working on a project, one way to help your design process is to write your project description. Although we often write our project descriptions as part of the documentation after the fact, it is often a useful process to clarify your thoughts and intentions about your project. Most importantly, it will help you focus on your central *design concept* that can ground your decisions as you refine your project.

Start drafting your project description paragraph. You might consider variations of one or more of the following sentences as a start. You are not required to use any of these sentences, but your description must clearly articulate:
- Your main idea driving the site
- Why this idea is relevant to and important to the content
- How you support this idea, with examples of specific design choices

```
This website is a ________ about ________. It uses ________ in order to ________.
```

```
This site draws attention to the ________ of ________.
```

```
I am expressing the ________ of the text through ________.
```

```
I’d like the website visitor to experience ________ through ________. 
```

```
The interactions of the website emphasize ________.
```

```
I’m considering this website as a ________ for ________.
```

Your project description should accompany the link to your project on your class homepage.
