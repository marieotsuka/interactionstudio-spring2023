Congratulations on completing the project! Even if you’re not totally done/things are broken, present what you have and talk through your design decisions. As long as you’re in class, presenting your project, you’re welcome to resubmit it by the end of the semester.

Please be mindful of our collective [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18OpXWbAZP7vYXoQGXmwQIeo0wqmJQTVKZ_MwJYp_1oc/edit#heading=h.jk2zh5757q55) we drafted in the beginning of the semester as we engage in our crit.

## Structure

With each project, we’ll be reviewing your website within our own browsers.

You’ll notice that on the [crit schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HKQRphQnvOJxPEDeGz13S4sc1yQgX5W183Eb_ylxN0M/edit#gid=1725466074), each person has been assigned a first responder (1R) second responder (2R), and notetaker (N). The first responder (1R) will kick off our discussion as soon as the presenter has finished sharing their work. The notetaker will listen carefully and document the highlights of the critique on [our document](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/6/folders/1EgrNR3ldGr58YNViY1WAH4UQsyhvDaM7)
