## Type Hunt

Let’s start with a collective brainstorm of typefaces — expressive and practical.
Add at least two typefaces to the [Fonts! channel](https://www.are.na/core-2-interaction-sp23/fonts-bogzro9wxbc) 


## Webfont [Demo](https://demos.webtype.xyz/week-1/type-demo/)

1. Go to https://github.com/marieotsuka/interaction-sp23demos
2. Click on the **Code** Button, and hit Download ZIP
 (You will learn how to automatically sync this repo on your desktop tomorrow)
3. Expand the zip, and open up the `week-1/type-demo/index.html` file.
4. Open the [type-demo] folder in Sublime Text.

Review the instructions, and load at least two new fonts by changing the HTML and CSS.
