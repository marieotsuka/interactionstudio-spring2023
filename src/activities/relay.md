title: "Responsive Relay"
week: 4
---

Let’s use responsive design techniques — the media query — to create a collaborative website.
Details of this exercise are outlined on the [Github](https://github.com/marieotsuka/int-sp23-relay) repo.

View [Responsive Design](/notes/04-responsive/) notes for additional technical reference. This exercise will require you to a) push to a collective [repository](https://github.com/marieotsuka/int-sp23-relay) — we will all be working on a single webpage — and b) use media queries to design for a particular “breakpoint.” You will then pass on the code to a fellow classmate.

This [exercise](https://mkim.netlify.app/gdfwf22/projects) has been adapted from [Minkyoung Kim](http://minkyoungkim.com/home/) and [Sophia Spitulnik](https://sophiaspitulnik.com/index.html).
