title: "Responsive Relay"
week: 4
---

Let’s use responsive design techniques — the media query — to create a collaborative website.
View [Responsive Design](/notes/04-responsive/) notes for additional technical reference. This exercise will require you to a) push to a collective [repository](https://github.com/marieotsuka/int-sp23-relay) — we will all be working on a single webpage — and b) use media queries to design for a particular “breakpoint.” You will then pass on the code to a fellow classmate.
