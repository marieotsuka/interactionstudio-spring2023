## Objectives
To design for a specific user in mind
To build an online tool
To use Javascript to create unique outputs

## Introduction
The web is capable of formatting and rendering webpages. It is also capable of completing tasks by taking input of the users. For example:
A gif converter on images and videos before posting social media.
A pixel image painter
A music player 

## Project
Create a set of rules which lead your website to generate contents and form by audience’s input. Use HTML, CSS and JS to make the website. In this project, we’ll explore the boundaries of what a tool can be when it is made on the web. It is very important that you test and try to use the tool you make. Ask as many people as possible to play with it. It will help you improve the tool. 

## Requirements
User can give an input to receive a unique output
Site should take advantage of different screen sizes

## Considerations
- Who is the audience? What mindset should the user be in when he/she uses the site? (Be specific)
- How does the user know what to do based on the design?
- What is the expected input? 
- What’s the output?
- What are some types of unexpected input?
