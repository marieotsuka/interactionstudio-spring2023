## Exercises

### Introduction
Using the history on your phone and laptop, map out where you have been on the internet in the last 24-48 hours. Think about how things are interlinked, what the types of things are, and about duration.

### Tell me a Story
Write a story in 5 parts. Each part should have 1–3 sentences each. The story can be real or imaginary.

## Project
Tell a story that begins with a web page you build and ends in a location on Google Maps or on YouTube, with a link to the starting point. Your story may be fiction or nonfiction. Traverse at least three platforms in between, leveraging the strengths of each to help your reader visualize the story. You could, for example, lead your reader to a Facebook post, then to an Amazon review, then to a LinkedIn profile, then to Instagram, and from Instagram to a dropped pin in Google maps. You can visit a platform more than once.
