		Readings will be dispersed throughout the semester to inform and contextualize our work with each project. Be prepared to respond, raise questions, and discuss the text during class by posting a comment or question on the relevant Slack channel.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each student will be responsible for being a lead in the reading discussion: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rBKuPsYTBMxVNHjSbYHmnmO-pFcVh0YOJWoF0vkWlUQ/edit#gid=0">Sign Up here</a>. This involves kicking-off the discussion with a brief summary of the reading, preparing at least three discussion questions, sharing any relevant works, and readiness to respond to your peersâ€™ responses.
